# What are Microservices

Microservices is an architectural approach to development that contrast with traditional, monolithic applications (where the entire application is considered and developed as a single entity). The microservice architecture breaks the application into different loosely coupled services.

# Role of Microservices in DevOps

In order to understand the role of Microservices in DevOps, letâ€™s consider a DevOps pipeline for developing a microservices-based application.

The first thing that microservices changes is how organizations approach development. As everything is broken down into separate services, development teams can also be divided to tackle each service. This will, in turn, reduce the scope of the development while making the development process more flexible.
